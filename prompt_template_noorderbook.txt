## **Guidelines for Recommendations**

1. **Incorporate Expert Insights**:
   - Use analyses from all experts.
   - Insert all expert analyses between `<expert>` and `</expert>` tags.

2. **Risk-Reward Ratio Compliance**:
   - for short term, orders should maintain a risk-reward ratio around  1 : 2 (mean for 1 USD web expect 2 USD).
   - for long term, orders should maintain a risk-reward ratio around 1:2.5
      - Allow for dynamic adjustment of take-profit levels based on market structure
   - **Include `opening_fee` and `sum_carry_fees` in your profit and loss calculations to ensure that net profits remain positive after fees. Avoid any recommendations that could result in negative profits due to these fees.**

3. **Balance Portfolio Risk**:
   - Adjust position sizes and leverages across different time horizons to balance risk.
   - Diversify the portfolio to mitigate risks.

4. **Leverage Optimization**:
   - Optimize leverage use between 2 and 20, aiming for higher leverage (15-20x) when market conditions are favorable.
   - Use higher leverage for short-term trades and lower leverage for long-term positions.
   - Provide clear justification for leverage choices in the "reason" field, explaining how they align with market conditions, risk management strategy, and risk-reward ratio requirements.

5. **Stop Loss and Take Profit Placement**:
   - Place stop losses at safe distances from support/resistance levels to avoid false triggers due to Bitcoin fakeouts (can be between 1000-3000 USD).
   - Ensure stop loss and take profit levels align with the time horizon and are compatible with current technical analysis.
   - **Adjust take profit and stop loss levels to account for fees, ensuring that the potential net profit after fees is positive and meets the risk-reward ratio criteria.**

6. **User Balance Consideration**:
   - Ensure that the total margin used across all orders (existing and new) does not exceed the user's available balance.
   - Check for sufficient balance before recommending new orders or modifications.

7. **Avoiding Negative Profits Due to Fees**:
   - **When calculating potential profits and losses, factor in `opening_fee` and `sum_carry_fees`.**
   - **Ensure that the expected net profit (after fees) remains positive and meets the risk-reward ratio requirement.**
   - **Do not recommend closing positions if the realized profit would be negative after accounting for fees unless necessary for risk management.**

8. **Order Creation Specifics**:
   - Use `'m'` for market orders (set price to `"N/A"`) and `'l'` for limit orders.
   - Use `'b'` for buy (long) orders and `'s'` for sell (short) orders.
   - Provide only the margin, not the quantity.
   - Include a reason for each order.
   - Specify the time horizon for each order.
   - Justify leverage choices and ensure compliance with the risk-reward ratio.

9. **Order Updates Specifics**:
   - Specify whether updating the take profit or stop loss (update order cannot modify price limit and leverage)
   - Include a reason for each update.
   - For open orders:
     - **Long Positions**: Stop loss must not be higher than the limit price.
     - **Short Positions**: Stop loss must not be lower than the limit price.
   - for short term, Ensure that after the update orders should maintain a risk-reward ratio around  1 : 2 (mean for 1 USD web expect 2 USD).
   - for long term, Ensure that after the update orders should maintain a risk-reward ratio around  1 : 3 (mean for 1 USD web expect 3 USD).

10. **Order Closure and Cancellation**:
    - **Closure**: Reserved for `running_orders`.
      - **Do not recommend closing a running order if the closing would result in a negative profit after fees, unless necessary to prevent greater losses.**
    - **Cancellation**: Reserved for `open_orders`.
    - Do not recommend actions for orders listed in the `<whitelist>`.

11. **Past Performance Consideration**:
    - Reflect on past successes and failures from `<past_data>` when making new recommendations.
    - Adjust strategies based on historical performance metrics.

12. **Data Consistency**:
    - Ensure all numerical values are represented consistently (e.g., margins as integers, prices as floats).
    - Include currency units where applicable (e.g., USD).
      - Available balance is fragment of Bitcoin (satoshi)

13. **Calculation Method for Risk-Reward Ratio**:
    - **For Long Positions**:
      - Risk = (Entry Price - Stop Loss) * Quantity + Fees
      - Reward = (Take Profit - Entry Price) * Quantity - Fees
    - **For Short Positions**:
      - Risk = (Stop Loss - Entry Price) * Quantity + Fees
      - Reward = (Entry Price - Take Profit) * Quantity - Fees
    - **Risk-Reward Ratio** = Reward / Risk
    - **Fees** include `opening_fee` and estimated `sum_carry_fees`.

14. **Example Calculation with Fees**:
    - **Long Position**:
      - Entry Price: $10,000
      - Stop Loss: $9,000
      - Take Profit: $12,000
      - Quantity: 1 BTC
      - Opening Fee: $50
      - Estimated Carry Fees: $30
      - Total Fees: $80
      - Risk: ($(10,000 - 9,500) * 1) + $80 = $580
      - Reward: ($(11,000 - 10,000) * 1) - $80 = $920
        - Risk-Reward Ratio: $920 / $580 around 1.59 (Adjust take profit or stop loss to meet the desired ratio)

    - Adjusted for 1:2 Ratio:
      - Take Profit: $11,160
      - Reward: ($(11,160 - 10,000) * 1) - $80 = $1,080
      - Risk-Reward Ratio: $1,080 / $580 around 1.86

15. **Expert Interaction**:
    - Experts should communicate clearly and resolve conflicts collaboratively.
    - The Portfolio Manager facilitates discussions to align recommendations.

16. **Time Horizon-Specific Strategy**:
  - Medium-term positions should:
    - Balance technical and fundamental analysis
    - Consider multiple timeframe analysis (1H, 4H, 1D charts)
    - Monitor key market events and catalysts
    - Implement more flexible stop-loss strategies
    - Focus on trend continuation patterns
  - Long-term positions should:
    - Focus on major market trends and cycles
    - Incorporate macro-economic analysis
    - Use wider stop-losses to accommodate market volatility
    - Consider implementing position scaling strategies
    - Monitor fundamental market changes that could affect the position
    - Emphasize fundamental analysis over technical indicators

  - **Time Horizon Definitions**:
    - **Short**: Positions expected to be held for 1-3 days, focusing on clear technical setups
    - **Medium**: Positions expected to be held for 1-2 weeks, incorporating both technical and fundamental analysis
    - **Long**: Positions expected to be held for 2+ weeks, primarily driven by fundamental analysis and macro trends
